<p>Sesame Chicken is an incredibly popular takeout dish but youâ€™re going to be blown away when you learn how easy and simple it is to make at home! The crispy chicken coated in that sweet and aromatic sesame sauce is a guaranteed crowd pleaser!</p>

<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 Lb chicken</li>
    <li>1 tbs kosher salt</li>
    <li>1?2 tbs white pepper</li>
    <li>2 tbs soy sauce</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 tbs ginger</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Slice chicken breast into 1/2" pieces and place in a bowl with kosher salt, white pepper, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil. Marinate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight for best results.

        </li></p>

        <p><li>In a large bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, kosher slat, white pepper, and baking powder.
        </li></p>

        <p><li>In a separate bowl, create your sauce by combining light soy sauce, ketchup, chicken stock, brown sugar, honey, and sesame oil. Mix until well combined and set aside.
        </li></p>

        <p><li>Dredge your marinated chicken in the flour & cornstarch mixture (shake off excess). Pack in the dredge to ensure there are no dry spots. Let rest on a rack for 10-15 minutes while you heat your oil. In the meantime, chop garlic and ginger, and prepare vinegar, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and your cornstarch slurry and set next to your pan.
        </li></p>

        <p><li>In a heavy bottomed pot or dutch oven, heat oil to 350F and fry the chicken in batches for 2-3 minutes until lightly golden. Remove, then fry a second time at 350F for 1-2 minute until golden and extra crispy. Season with salt to taste.
        </li></p>

        <p><li>In a pan or wok over high heat, add 2 tbsp of neutral oil and fry your garlic and ginger for 15 seconds or until fragrant. Immediately add your sauce until it starts to bubble (about 45-60 seconds). Add your cornstarch slurry and your vinegar, and continue stirring until the sauce has thickened. Add your chicken and coat in the sauce and finish with sesame seeds and sesame oil. Enjoy!
