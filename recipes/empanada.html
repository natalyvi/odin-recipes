    <h1>EMPANADAS</h1>

    <h2>You can never have just one empanada!</h2>
    <p>Empanadas are one of my favorite Mexican dishes! It’s not as hard as you would think to make these at home. All you need is a few pantry staples to make the empanada dough and the filling can be made with whatever you have on hand! The empanada dough is similar to a pie dough. It is made with cold butter, cold water, flour and egg. It comes out perfectly flakey, crispy and golden brown! The homemade empanadas are then stuffed with ground beef, potatoes, cumin, chili powder, paprika, peas and fresh herbs. These are the best empanadas you will ever have!</p>
    <p>Stuffed pastries are universal. Every culture has their own version, from Chinese dumplings to Polish pierogies to Indian samosas. I grew up eating empanadas, but by contrast, they weren’t traditional to a specific cuisine. While empanadas from Mexico are usually made with masa, my grandma—a woman who grew up in Culiacán, a city in northwestern Mexico—made hers with pot sticker wrappers! During the creation of this dish, we figured that if you’re searching for an empanada recipe, you’re probably not looking to fry them in pot sticker wrappers, so we developed an amazingly easy and flaky homemade dough. But we have modeled our filling after my grandma’s top-secret recipe. And if you REALLY want to go all-in on my grandma’s method, we’ve also included tips on how to use those pot-sticker wrappers. Read on for more tips for these Cheesy Beef Empanadas.</p>
    <p>During the development of this dish, I figured that if you’re searching for an empanada recipe, you’re mostly not looking to fry them in pot sticker wrappers. So, our associate food editor (and pastry queen) Makinze Gore developed an amazingly easy and flaky homemade dough.
