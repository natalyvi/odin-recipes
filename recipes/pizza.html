    <p>While pizzas nowadays get topped with all sorts of different cheeses, the one that is by far the most common is mozzarella—and for good reason. Mozzarella is a great topping for a classic cheese pizza for a few reasons, including the fact that it melts super well, especially if it’s fresh. Though you might not have put much thought into your cheese’s “meltiness” prior to now, its ability to boil and bubble away in the oven makes for a great texture and eating experience. Additionally, whole-milk mozzarella usually melts and stretches nicely on a pizza, so if you’re looking for the best cheese to sprinkle on your homemade pizza, reach for mozzarella. You could even try freshly grating some yourself.

           <p><li>Spread half of the sauce on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Top with half of the provolone, then with half each of the mozzarella and parmesan.</li></p>
           <p><li>Slide the pizza onto the hot stone or baking sheet and bake until the crust is browned and the cheese is melted, 10 to 12 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings. Makes 2 12-inch pizzas.</li></p>
