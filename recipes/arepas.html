<p>New York City was exciting for a lot of reasons, but as someone that has always been interested in food, I’m sure you could guess that I had reached my heaven. NYC is the epitome of a food lover’s paradise, and I was suddenly surrounded by so many delicious treats I couldn’t find enough time in three months to try them all. 

</p>
<p>One Saturday I was on my way to the bookstore down the block and stumbled across a farmers market/food festival happening on the avenue near my apartment. I bought a dress and a smoothie, but then suddenly my eyes found them…. Arepas. 

</p>
<p>The food truck that was selling arepas that day had packed them with fillings, specifically ooey, gooey mozzarella cheese. They were overflowing with cheese and I HAD to buy one!</p>
<p>Since that moment, I had been daydreaming about arepas. Obviously, it is a dream come true that I can now make them for the blog and share the recipe with you all. </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Masarepa</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <p><li>In a large bowl, place the masarepa and the salt. Stir to combine, then form a well in the middle. </li></p>
        <p><li>Little by little pour the water into the well. Use your hands to mix and knead the dough lightly until all water is combined. Cover with a towel and let rest for 5 minutes. </li></p>
        <p><li>Separate the dough into 8 sections and roll each section into a ball. Press the ball flat in your hand until about ½” thick. 

        </li></p>
        <p><li>Heat 2 tbsp vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet until warm. Place four arepas in the pan, cover and heat over low-medium heat for 6 minutes. Flip, cover, and heat on the other side for about 8 minutes, or until a crust is formed on both sides. 

        </li></p>
        <p><li>Remove the arepas from the stove. When cooled enough to handle, use a serrated knife to slice the arepas in half. Layer the inside with mozzarella cheese. Place back in the cast iron for about 5 minutes, just until the cheese gets melty. Enjoy!
